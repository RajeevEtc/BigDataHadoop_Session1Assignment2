1. __pwd__: Used to display the current working directory

2. __vi__: It used to open VI Editor. The vi editor (short for visual editor) is a screen editor which is available on almost all Unix systems. 
Example: 1. To create/open a file, following command can be used:
              $ vi filename

3.__touch__: The touch command updates the access and modification times of each FILE to the current system time.

Example: $touch testfile.txt
    If file.txt exists, touch updates its access and modification times to the current time. If file.txt doesn't exist, it is created as a new, empty file.
    
4.__mkdir__: Used to create a new directory.

Example: $mkdir music
    Creates a new directory called mydir whose parent is the current directory.
    
5.__rm__: It removes files or directories.

Example: __$rm -r mydirectory__
         It will remove the directory mydirectory, and any files and directories it contains. If a file or directory that rm tries to delete is write-protected, you will be prompted to make sure that you really want to delete it.
         $rm
